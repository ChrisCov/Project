Now I was in Hamley's this week and it's always fun to watch the guys doing their magic tricks. At the moment they're pimping the new Marvin's iMagic Tin of Tricks. It comes with some props and a code to activate their app, and you interect with your iOS or Android device to do various 'tricks'. This may be more entertaining for the youngsters with their xmas tablets and devices as some of the tricks are a bit gimmicky at least, but the card tricks they showed us in shop made us want to get hold of one.

In Hamley's though the Tin of Tricks is Â£35, so obviously we weren't going to pay that, so I had a look when we got home. The Tin of Tricks seems to be a Hamley's 'exclusive' for now which I can't find many details on, but the deal posted here is essentialy the same not 'limited edition' version, with the only difference being that the ltd Tin get a D'lite morph included, which I've not a huge craving for, and maybe this one includes the book and the tin doesn't? Not sure about that but this box is much larger than the tin version

This usually retails over Â£20 from what I can tell, rrp Â£25 and currently Â£22.99 on Amazon, so for Â£9.99 at Argos it's a bargain for the set, and also was available at every store I checked in London and Kent. Whether you think you'll like the smart device based nature is your own choice.

Here's the spiel for the kit:

Practical Caravan has teamed up with Apple Tree Exhibitions to offer ten lucky readers the chance to win a pair of tickets to the West Country Caravan and Motorhome Show.

The show is a great regional event for those based in the South West who donât wish to travel hundreds of miles for a national show. Taking place at Exeterâs Westpoint Arena on 11- 13 March 2106, Plymouth is only 40 minutes away and Bristol less than an hour. 

Open daily from 10am, the show is set to feature all the latest 2016 models from leading caravan manufacturers, including Swift, Bailey and Elddis. Plus, there will be plenty of used caravans on display too if new is not for you. Being a more intimate affair, this show is a great chance to browse the stands without the crowds and talk to dealers. You may even be lucky enough to negotiate a discount. 

Local dealers signed up to attend the West Country Caravan and Motorhome Show include; Stowford Caravan Centre, Somerset County Caravans, Exeter Caravan Centre, Go Pods and Perman Briggs Caravans.

Many stands will offer show only discounts too so itâs worth the journey if you want to bag a bargain. 

Those not in a hurry to get home should bring along the âvan and take advantage of the arenas close proximity to a number of great campsites and attractions. The historic city of Exeter is just six miles away. Here you will find a stunning cathedral at the heart of the city, as well as an excellent mix of shops, restaurants and pubs.
